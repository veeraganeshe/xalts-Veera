	                       **Incident Description 1**

   I. Initial Response (14:30 UTC - 14:45 UTC)
1. Acknowledge and Isolate:
Action: Acknowledge the incident and establish a communication channel (e.g., Slack war room).
Parameters: Monitor alerts from New Relic, CloudWatch, and Splunk for details on error rates and service health.
Root Cause (Probable): Sudden increase in traffic, application bug, or infrastructure issue.
Solution: Isolate the affected service by potentially scaling down or disabling non-critical functionalities to prevent further cascading failures.
2. Identify Root Cause:
Action: Analyze logs (Splunk) and application performance metrics (New Relic) for anomalies. Investigate resource utilization metrics (CloudWatch) for CPU, memory, or network issues on the Kubernetes cluster or RDS database.
Parameters: Look for spikes in API calls, database queries, errors, or resource exhaustion.
Root Cause (Probable):
Application layer: Code bug, memory leak, or high resource consumption by a specific function.
Infrastructure layer: Kubernetes pod crash, resource contention between pods, database overload, or network connectivity issues.
Solution: Based on identified anomalies, investigate further using debugging tools specific to the application and infrastructure (e.g., Kubernetes logs, database queries).
   II. Recovery and Resolution (14:45 UTC - 15:30 UTC):
1. Implement Fix:
Action: Depending on the root cause, this could involve deploying a code fix, scaling up resources, restarting pods, or optimizing database queries.
Parameters: Monitor the impact of the implemented fix on error rates and service health.
Solution:
Application layer: Deploy a hotfix or revert to a previous stable version.
Infrastructure layer: Scale up resources in the Kubernetes cluster or RDS database. Restart affected pods or optimize database queries based on analysis.
2. Monitor and Validate:
Action: Closely monitor the affected service and surrounding infrastructure for stability after implementing a fix.
Parameters: Continue monitoring metrics in New Relic, CloudWatch, and Splunk to ensure error rates have dropped and service is functioning normally.
Solution: If the implemented fix resolves the issue, proceed to full recovery. If not, repeat the identification and implementation steps.
   III. Post-Incident Review (After 15:30 UTC):
1. Document and Analyze:
Action: Document the entire incident response process, including the timeline, actions taken, root cause analysis, and implemented solutions.
Parameters: Analyze the effectiveness of the response plan and identify areas for improvement in future incidents.
Solution: Conduct a post-mortem meeting with the involved team to share learnings and discuss potential preventative measures to avoid similar outages.
2. Preventative Measures:
Action: Based on the identified root cause, implement preventative measures.
Solution:
Application layer: Implement automated testing, code reviews, and performance monitoring to detect and prevent regressions.
Infrastructure layer: Implement horizontal pod autoscaling (HPA) for automatic resource scaling, conduct load testing to identify capacity limits, and explore database optimization techniques.

		                  	**Incident Description 2:**
Root Cause:
The root cause of the incident is primarily attributed to human error, specifically accidental deletion by the user. The lack of proper access controls or safeguards to prevent unauthorized deletion contributed to the occurrence of this incident.
     Recovery Process:
Immediate Assessment: Upon detection of the incident, the Site Reliability Engineer should promptly assess the impact and urgency of file recovery.
Isolation: Isolate the affected server or directory to prevent further unintended actions or data loss.
Backup Verification: Check if a recent backup of the deleted file is available and accessible for restoration.
File Recovery and Implementation : Utilize file recovery tools or techniques to attempt the restoration of the deleted file from the server's storage.Verify the latest AMI and spin up new instances using it to substitute the impacted instance. Alternatively, duplicate the files from a newly created instance to the affected one. Additionally, examine the configuration store, such as S3 or Vault, to determine if file recovery is feasible from there.
Verification: Once the file is recovered, verify its integrity and functionality to ensure it contains the required credentials and is usable for its intended purpose.
Testing: Conduct thorough testing to validate the restored file's functionality and its impact on system operations.
Monitoring: Implement monitoring mechanisms to track file changes and user activities to detect and respond promptly to any similar incidents in the future.
Preventive Measures:
User Training and Awareness: Provide comprehensive training to users on proper file management practices, emphasizing the importance of verifying actions before execution to minimize the risk of accidental deletions.
Access Controls: Implement role-based access controls (RBAC) and permissions to restrict unauthorized users from deleting critical files or directories.
File Versioning and Backups: Establish a robust backup strategy, including regular automated backups and versioning of critical files to ensure their availability for recovery in case of accidental deletions or other data loss incidents.
Audit Trails: Enable logging and auditing functionalities to maintain a record of user activities, including file deletions, to facilitate incident investigation and accountability.
Automated Alerts: Configure automated alerts and notifications to immediately notify Site Reliability Engineers or DevOps Engineers, or relevant personnel of any suspicious or potentially harmful actions, such as file deletions, to enable prompt intervention.
Regular Review and Updates: Conduct periodic reviews of access controls, backup procedures, and user permissions to identify and address any potential vulnerabilities or shortcomings in the system's security posture.
